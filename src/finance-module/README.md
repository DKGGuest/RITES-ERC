### Data Flow
1. **useFinanceData** hook fetches and manages all financial data
2. **usePaymentActions** hook handles payment approval/return operations
3. **useBillingActions** hook handles bill generation and payment recording
4. Components consume hooks and render UI
5. User actions trigger hook functions
6. Data refreshes automatically after actions

## Usage

### Basic Integration
```javascript
import { FinanceDashboard } from './finance-module';

function App() {
  return <FinanceDashboard />;
}
```

### Using Individual Components
```javascript
import { 
  VendorPaymentsTab,
  useFinanceData,
  usePaymentActions 
} from './finance-module';

function CustomFinanceView() {
  const { pendingPayments } = useFinanceData();
  const { approvePayment, returnPayment } = usePaymentActions();
  
  return (
    <VendorPaymentsTab
      payments={pendingPayments}
      onApprove={approvePayment}
      onReturn={returnPayment}
    />
  );
}
```

## Key Workflows

### Payment Approval Workflow
1. Finance user views pending payments
2. Reviews payment details and documents
3. Either approves with optional remarks OR returns with mandatory reason
4. System updates status and logs action
5. Notification sent to relevant parties

### Billing Workflow
1. IC issued by inspection team
2. Record appears in "Pending Billing" tab
3. Finance generates bill with amount details
4. System calculates GST automatically
5. Bill moves to "Bills Generated" tab
6. Payment recorded when received
7. Bill marked as cleared after verification
8. Complete audit trail maintained

### Suspense Handling
1. Payment issues identified (e.g., outstanding dues)
2. Record marked as "Under Suspense"
3. Suspense reason documented
4. Billing blocked until issue resolved
5. Clear audit trail of suspense period
